[Add Digits](https://leetcode.com/problems/add-digits/)

Given an integer `num`, repeatedly add all its digits until the result has only one digit, and return it.

#### Example 1:

```js
Input: num = 38
Output: 2
Explanation: The process is
38 --> 3 + 8 --> 11
11 --> 1 + 1 --> 2
Since 2 has only one digit, return it.
```

#### Example 2:

```js
Input: num = 0;
Output: 0;
```

#### Constraints:

- `0 <= num <= 2³¹ - 1`
